  <em>Add Virtual VRAM and unleash the power of all of your latent space</em>
</p>


## Device selection and model offloading tools for ComfyUI workloads that exceed single GPU capacity

This extension empowers users to spread model components across multiple GPUs or offload to CPU in a single ComfyUI workflow. Aimed at complex workloads that would normally require sequential model loading/unloading:

- Full control over model placement
- Support for all major model loader nodes
- NEW! GGUF UNet and CLIP model-splitting across cpu/gpus using new DisTorch nodes.

*EXPERIMENTAL: This extension modifies ComfyUI's memory management behavior. While functional for standard GPU and CPU configurations, edge cases may exist. Use at your own risk.*

**Note:** This enhances memory management, not parallelism. Workflow steps execute sequentially but with components, or in the case of GGUF files `GGML` layers, loaded across your specified devices. *Performance gains* come from avoiding repeated model loading/unloading when VRAM is constrained. *Capability gains* come from offloading as much of the model (VAE/CLIP/UNet) off of your main `compute` device, allowing you to maximize the amount of latent space available for `compute`

  <em>DisTorch 2.0 in Action</em>
</p>



## What's New?
DisTorch now features simple Virtual VRAM control that lets you offload model layers from your GPU with zero configuration. Just set how much VRAM you want to free up, and DisTorch handles the rest.

## How It Works
- **Virtual VRAM**: Defaults to 4GB - just adjust it based on your needs
- **Two Modes**:
  - **Default**: Offloads to system RAM
  - **Multi-GPU**: Distributes across other GPUs (optional)

## 🎯 Key Benefits
- Free up GPU VRAM instantly without complex settings
- Run larger models by offloading layers to other system RAM
- Use all your main GPU's VRAM for actual `compute` / latent processing
- Seamlessly distribute GGML layers across multiple GPUs if available
- Allows **you** to easily shift from ___on-device speed___ to ___open-device capability___ with a simple one-number change

  <em>DisTorch 2.0 Node with one simple number to tune its Vitual VRAM to your needs</em>
</p>

## 💡 Quick Start
1. Load any GGUF model using a DisTorch node
2. Set your Virtual VRAM amount (default: 4GB, in this example we chose 8GB)
3. Toggle "Use Other VRAM" if you have multiple GPUs[^1]
4. That's it!
[^1]:  DisTorch's Virtual VRAM aims to span as few a devices as possible. I recommend users try both ways (VRAM/DRAM) and see which works best for you.

## 🔄 Real-World Example
With a 12GB GPU running an 8GB model:
- Set Virtual VRAM to 4GB
- DisTorch moves 4GB of model layers to RAM
- Your GPU now has extra VRAM for larger batches, higher resolutions, or longer video

## 🚀 Compatibility
Works with all GGUF-quantized ComfyUI/ComfyUI-GGUF-supported UNet/CLIP models.

⚙️ Expert users: For those of you who were here for the 1.0 release of DisTorch, manual allocation strings still available for advanced configurations. Each log will contain the allocation string for the run so it can be easily recreated and/or manipulated for more sophisticated setups.

This workflow attaches a HunyuanVideo GGUF-quantized model on `cuda:0` for compute and distrubutes its UNet across itself and the `cpu`. Kijai's IP2V clip loader is loaded on the `cpu`. While the VAE is loaded on GPU 1 directly and uses `cuda:1` for compute.

- [examples/hunyuan_gguf_distorch.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuan_gguf_distorch.json)
This workflow attaches a HunyuanVideo GGUF-quantized model on `cuda:0` for compute and distrubutes its UNet across itself, a secondary CUDA device, and the system's main memory (`cpu`) using a new DisTorch distributed-load methodology. The text encoder now attaches itself to `cuda:1` and splits iteself between `cuda:1` amd `cpu` layers. While the VAE is loaded on GPU 1 directly and uses `cuda:1` for compute.

- [examples/flux1dev_gguf_distorch.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/flux1dev_gguf_distorch.json)

This allows the benefit of kijai's proecessing node with the flexibility of a MultiGPU setup.

- [examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_select_device.json](https://github.com/pollockjj/ComfyUI-MultiGPU/blob/main/examples/hunyuanvideowrapper_select_device.json)
